# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001: Use PyQt5 Instead of PyQt6

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need a mature, cross-platform GUI framework with rich widgets

**Decision**: Use PyQt5 5.15.11

**Rationale**:
- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- Better backwards compatibility
- Proven stability on Windows/macOS
- Original project used PyQt5

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Stable, well-tested
- ✅ Large community support
- ⚠️ PyQt6 is newer but would require migration

---

## ADR-002: Use Ultralytics for SAM Integration

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to integrate Segment Anything Model 2 for semi-automated annotation

**Decision**: Use Ultralytics library instead of direct SAM2 installation

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies SAM model loading (single line)
- Includes PyTorch dependencies
- Automatic model caching
- No manual model download required
- Supports both SAM 2.0 and SAM 2.1 variants

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simplified installation (no separate SAM2 setup)
- ✅ Automatic model management
- ✅ Consistent API
- ⚠️ Dependency on Ultralytics release cycle

---

## ADR-003: Store Absolute Paths in Project Files

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Project files need to reference image locations

**Decision**: Store absolute paths to images in project JSON

**Rationale**:
- Images can be anywhere on filesystem
- No requirement to keep images with project file
- Simplifies project structure

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Flexible image locations
- ❌ Projects not portable between machines
- ❌ Moving images breaks projects

**Mitigation**: Export functions copy images to output directory

---

## ADR-004: No Automated Testing Framework

**Status**: Accepted (Technical Debt)

**Context**: Application is GUI-heavy with complex interactions

**Decision**: Rely on manual testing only

**Rationale**:
- PyQt testing requires significant setup (pytest-qt, fixtures)
- Visual nature of tool makes automated testing difficult
- Small development team
- Rapid iteration on features

**Consequences**:
- ❌ Risk of regressions
- ❌ Manual testing required for all changes
- ❌ Slower development velocity for large refactors
- ✅ Lower initial development overhead

**Future Consideration**: Add unit tests for utility functions (calculate_area, conversions)

---

## ADR-005: Disable Autosave During Project Loading

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Projects were getting corrupted when application terminated during loading (v0.8.9 bug)

**Decision**: Set `is_loading_project` flag to disable autosave during load

**Rationale**:
- Autosave triggered with partially loaded state corrupts file
- Loading large projects is slow, increases risk
- Simple flag prevents the issue

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Prevents project corruption
- ✅ Minimal code change
- ⚠️ Users lose autosave protection during load window

---

## ADR-006: Use Shapely for Polygon Operations

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to merge, validate, and manipulate polygon geometries

**Decision**: Use Shapely library for all polygon operations

**Rationale**:
- Industry-standard computational geometry library
- Handles invalid polygons gracefully
- Efficient union/intersection operations
- Well-tested algorithms

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Robust polygon handling
- ✅ Easy merge operations
- ✅ Automatic polygon validation
- ⚠️ Additional dependency

---

## ADR-007: Flatten Polygon Coordinates in Storage

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to store polygon annotations

**Decision**: Store as flattened list `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]` instead of nested `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]`

**Rationale**:
- Compatible with COCO JSON format
- Smaller file size
- Standard in annotation tools

**Consequences**:
- ✅ COCO compatibility
- ✅ Compact representation
- ⚠️ Must convert to/from paired format for some operations

---

## ADR-008: Support Multiple Export Formats

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Users need annotations in different formats for various ML frameworks

**Decision**: Implement exporters for COCO, YOLO, Pascal VOC, labeled images, semantic labels

**Rationale**:
- Different frameworks have different input requirements
- YOLO and COCO are most common
- Labeled images useful for visual verification
- Semantic labels needed for segmentation models

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Wide compatibility
- ✅ Flexible workflow
- ⚠️ More code to maintain
- ⚠️ Must keep up with format changes (e.g., YOLOv11)

---

## ADR-009: Use Per-Slice Annotation Storage for Multi-dimensional Images

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: TIFF stacks and CZI files have multiple slices that need individual annotations

**Decision**: Store annotations per slice with naming convention `{filename}_T{t}_Z{z}_C{c}`

**Rationale**:
- Each slice is effectively a separate 2D image
- Simple extension of existing single-image annotation
- User can navigate and annotate independently

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simple mental model (each slice = image)
- ✅ Reuses existing annotation code
- ⚠️ Large stacks create many entries in annotations dict
- ⚠️ No 3D annotation support

---

## ADR-010: Normalize 16-bit Images to 8-bit for Display

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: SAM and display require 8-bit images, but microscopy often uses 16-bit

**Decision**: Normalize 16-bit to 8-bit using percentile clipping

**Rationale**:
- SAM models trained on 8-bit RGB images
- Displays only show 8-bit effectively
- Percentile clipping (2nd-98th) provides better contrast than linear

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better visual contrast
- ✅ SAM compatibility
- ⚠️ Information loss (quantization)
- ⚠️ Different normalization per image/slice

---

## Decisions Under Consideration

### Consider pytest-qt for Utility Testing

**Status**: Under Consideration

**Proposal**: Add unit tests for non-GUI utilities (calculate_area, coordinate conversions, export functions)

**Pros**:
- Catch regressions in utility functions
- Build confidence for refactoring
- Document expected behavior

**Cons**:
- Setup overhead
- Maintenance burden
- May not catch most bugs (which are in GUI)

---

### Consider Relative Paths with Image Copying

**Status**: Under Consideration

**Proposal**: Copy images to project folder, store relative paths

**Pros**:
- Portable projects
- Self-contained

**Cons**:
- Disk space duplication
- Slow for large image sets
- Export already copies images
